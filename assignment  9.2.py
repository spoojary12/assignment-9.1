#Write a txt file which has a word in each line like:
##Legs
#India
#Crow
#Rain
#Write a python code to read the file and store the words in the list
#Write a function to guess a word randomly from the list.
#Now, write a function which asks user to guess the chosen word letter by letter.
#Show "incorrect" message to the wrong guessed letter.
#Display  letters in the clue word that were guessed correctly.
#Let say word is EVAPORATE
#>>> Welcome to Hangman!
#_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
#>>> Guess your letter: S
#Incorrect!
#You left with 5 chances to guess.
#>>> Guess your letter:
#E _ _ _ _ _ _ _ E
#And so on.
#1)Only let the user guess 6 times, and tell the user how many guesses they have left.
#Keep track of the letters the user guessed.
#2) If the user guesses a letter they already guessed, donâ€™t penalize them - let them guess again.
#3)When the player wins or loses, let them start a new game.
